# Gender Pay Gap Remediation Research

## Management Intervention Strategies

### Immediate Adjustment Approaches
1. **Lump Sum Correction**: One-time salary adjustment to close gaps
2. **Accelerated Review Cycles**: More frequent performance reviews for affected groups
3. **Targeted Increases**: Above-average increases for underrepresented groups
4. **Market Adjustment**: Benchmarking against industry standards

### Gradual Remediation Strategies
1. **Enhanced Performance Recognition**: Higher ratings for equivalent performance
2. **Promotional Acceleration**: Faster level progression opportunities
3. **Skill Development Investment**: Training and development priority
4. **Mentorship Programs**: Career advancement support

## Cost Analysis Framework

### Budget Impact Calculation
```
total_remediation_cost = Î£(target_salary - current_salary) for affected_employees
percentage_of_payroll = total_remediation_cost / total_annual_payroll
```

### Typical Industry Costs
- **Immediate correction**: 0.4-0.6% of total payroll
- **3-year gradual approach**: 0.15-0.2% per year
- **5-year natural convergence**: Minimal additional cost

### ROI Considerations
- Reduced legal risk
- Improved employee retention
- Enhanced company reputation
- Increased productivity and engagement

## Simulation Modeling Approaches

### Scenario Analysis
1. **No Intervention**: Natural market forces only
2. **Gradual Correction**: 3-5 year remediation timeline
3. **Aggressive Correction**: 1-2 year complete gap closure
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Immediate + gradual components

### Success Metrics
- **Gap Reduction Rate**: % reduction per review cycle
- **Time to Parity**: Years to achieve statistical equality
- **Sustainability**: Maintenance of equity over time
- **Employee Satisfaction**: Perception of fairness
