# Industry Approaches to Salary Equity Gap Analysis and Intervention Cost Modeling

*Research conducted: August 11, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive research on industry approaches to salary equity gap analysis and intervention cost modeling methodologies. The research covers statistical methods, cost-effectiveness frameworks, business case development, and implementation strategies used by leading organizations and consulting firms.

## Key Findings Overview

### Statistical Significance Standards
- **Primary Threshold**: 5% significance level (p-value ≤ 0.05) for identifying statistically significant disparities
- **Remediation Threshold**: 10% significance level (p-value ≤ 0.10) often used as target for minimum remediation
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Testing that pay for different groups is same after controlling for relevant factors

### Cost-Effectiveness Metrics
- **ROI Measurement**: Disparity reduction amount divided by remediation budget
- **Industry Benchmark**: $1.31 disparity reduction per dollar spent on remediation
- **Effectiveness Definition**: Addressing root causes and reducing probability of issues reappearing

## Primary Analytical Methodologies

### 1. Regression Analysis Framework

#### Core Approach
Regression analysis serves as the primary method for testing pay equity, allowing organizations to examine multiple variables simultaneously and control for legitimate pay differences.

#### Statistical Modeling Process
```
Regression Equation:
Pay = β₀ + β₁(Gender) + β₂(Race) + β₃(Experience) + β₄(Education) + ... + βₙ(Variable n) + ε

Where:
- β₀ = Intercept (baseline pay)
- β₁, β₂ = Coefficients for protected characteristics
- β₃, β₄, βₙ = Coefficients for legitimate pay factors
- ε = Error term
```

#### Variable Controls
Organizations typically include these control variables:
- **Location**: Geographic pay differentials and cost of living adjustments
- **Education**: Degree level, relevant certifications, specialized training
- **Performance**: Ratings, reviews, achievement metrics
- **Experience**: Total years, relevant experience, tenure with organization
- **Job Characteristics**: Level, supervisory responsibilities, specialized skills
- **Department/Function**: Organizational unit, job family classification

### 2. Adjusted Pay Gap Calculation

#### Methodology
Statistical modeling controls all salary drivers and isolates the effect of protected characteristics, creating what is called the "adjusted pay gap."

#### Example Analysis Results
```
Unadjusted Gender Pay Gap: $20,184
After controlling for legitimate factors:
Final Adjusted Gap: $647 (not statistically significant)

Statistical Transformation:
Initial Gap → Controlled Analysis → Adjusted Gap → Significance Test
```

#### Interpretation Standards
- **Statistically Significant**: Requires remediation action (p ≤ 0.05)
- **Not Significant**: No action required, but continued monitoring recommended
- **Borderline Cases**: May warrant investigation even if not statistically significant

## Remediation Strategy Options

### 1. Class Effect Strategy

#### Definition and Application
All members of an impacted demographic class receive uniform percentage adjustment to address the class effect revealed by regression analysis.

#### Cost Calculation
```
Class Effect Remediation Cost:
Total Cost = Σ (Class Members × Average Salary × Adjustment Percentage)

Example:
- 600 employees affected
- Average adjustment: 2.8% of annual salary
- Total cost: $850,000
```

#### Implementation Characteristics
- **Straightforward Implementation**: Same percentage for all class members
- **Direct Relationship**: Most directly addresses identified pay disparity
- **Administrative Efficiency**: Minimal individual case-by-case review required

### 2. Class + Individual Effect Focused Strategy

#### Methodology
Combines class-based adjustments with individual outlier corrections for employees beyond specific statistical thresholds.

#### Cost Structure
```
Focused Strategy Components:
- Class Effect Adjustments: For all members of impacted groups
- Individual Outlier Corrections: For employees >1.5 standard deviations below predicted pay
- Total Cost: Typically $1.2 million for 400 adjustments (industry example)
```

#### Selection Criteria
- **Statistical Threshold**: Common use of 1.5 standard deviation cutoff
- **Individual Assessment**: Case-by-case review of significant outliers
- **Targeted Approach**: More precise but requires additional analysis

### 3. Class + Individual Effect Broad Strategy

#### Comprehensive Approach
Broader application of both class and individual adjustments with lower thresholds for intervention.

#### Cost Implications
- **Higher Total Investment**: Most comprehensive and expensive approach
- **Maximum Coverage**: Addresses both systematic and individual disparities
- **Long-term Sustainability**: May provide most durable equity improvements

## Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Framework

### ROI Measurement Methodology

#### Primary Formula
```
Pay Equity ROI = Total Disparity Reduction / Total Remediation Budget

Industry Benchmark: $1.31 reduction per $1.00 invested
```

#### Example ROI Calculation
```
Case Study Analysis:
- Total Disparity Identified: $1.1 million
- Remediation Budget Spent: $850,000
- ROI Ratio: $1.29 per dollar spent
- Net Benefit: $250,000 in disparity reduction beyond costs
```
